# Hazelcast and Quarkus

<a href="https://github.com/actions/toolkit"><img alt="GitHub Actions status" src="https://github.com/pivovarit/quarkus-hazelcast-client-extension/workflows/build/badge.svg"></a>

## Features
- Lazy init for client (TODO)

### Configuration using `hazelcast.yml`

In order to configure client using the `hazelcast.yml` file, place the configuration file in `src/main/resources` and add the following Quarkus configuration entry:

    quarkus.hazelcast-client.config-source=yaml
    
### Configuration using `hazelcast.xml` (not supported in native mode)

In order to configure client using the `hazelcast.xml` file, place the configuration file in `src/main/resources` and add the following Quarkus configuration entry:

    quarkus.hazelcast-client.config-source=xml
    
Configuration entries from `hazelcast.yml` will override all `quarkus.hazelcast-client.*` entries.

## Limitations
- Default serialization is not supported in native mode
- Configuration via `hazelcast.xml` is not fully supported
